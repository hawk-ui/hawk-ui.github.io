        <h2 class="content-head is-center">Introduction to Hawk</h2>

        <div class="pure-g">
          <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1 pure-u-md-3-5">

            <h4>Overview</h4>

            <p>
              Hawk is a web interface for the Pacemaker High Availability stack. The
              goal of the project is to create a complete interface to the HA
              cluster, including the configuration, management and monitoring of
              cluster resources.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hawk runs on every node in the cluster, so that you can just point
              your web browser at any node to access it. E.g.:
            </p>

            <pre class="code is-center">https://your-cluster-node:7630/</pre>

            <p>
              Hawk is always accessed via HTTPS, and requires users to log in prior
              to providing access to the cluster. The same user privilege rules
              apply as for Pacemaker itself: You need to log in as a user in the
              <tt>haclient</tt> group. The easiest thing to do is to assign a password to
              the <tt>hacluster</tt> user, and then to log in using that account. Note that
              you will need to configure this user account on every node that you
              will use Hawk on.
            </p>

            <p>
              For more fine-grained control over access to the cluster, you can
              create multiple user accounts and configure Access Control Lists (ACL)
              for those users. These access control rules are available directly
              from the Hawk user interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              Once logged in, you will see a status view displaying the current
              state of the cluster. All the configured cluster resources are shown
              together with their status, as well as a general state of the cluster
              and a list of recent cluster events (if any).
            </p>

            <p>
              The navigation menu on the left hand side provides access to the
              additional features of Hawk, such as the history explorer, the
              multi-cluster dashboard and configuration management. On the top right
              of the screen you can enable or disable the simulator, configure user
              preferences and log out of the cluster.
            </p>

            <p>
              Resource management operations (start, stop, online, standby, etc.)
              can be performed using the menu of operations next to the resource in
              the status view.
            </p>

            <p>
              Latest release: <a href="https://github.com/ClusterLabs/hawk/releases/tag/hawk-2.0.0">Version 2.0.0</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              The easiest way to get Hawk is to use
              the <a href="https://www.suse.com/products/highavailability/">SUSE
              Linux Enterprise</a>
              or <a href="https://www.opensuse.org/">openSUSE</a>
              Linux distributions. We try to make sure that it works
              on other distributions
              and <a href="https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/network:ha-clustering:Factory/hawk2">make
              packages available</a> for as many as we are able.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another way to try Hawk is to look at
              the <a href="https://hawk-guide.readthedocs.io/">guide</a>,
              which includes a Vagrant configuration to set up a 1 - 3
              node cluster.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone willing to help us maintain packages for other
              distributions is more than welcome!

            <h4>Frontend redesign</h4>
            <p>
              The Hawk frontend has been modernised, and now uses
              Bootstrap 3. The layout and organization of the user
              interface has been rethought with usability in mind.
            </p>

            <h4>Updated backend</h4>
            <p>
              Hawk 2 is based on Ruby on Rails 4.2 running on the Puma
              web server. By using Puma, we can make Hawk as
              unintrusive as possible on the cluster nodes without
              compromising performance. In fact, thanks to the use of
              asset precompilation Hawk 2 should perform better than
              the Hawk 1 interface despite the updated visual style.
            </p>

            <h4>Wizards</h4>
            <p>
              In Hawk 1, the wizards were implemented as a custom
              solution. For Hawk 2, the wizards have been moved into
              the crm shell, making them available from the command
              line as well. In addition to this move, the wizards have
              been greatly improved. They now feature optional steps
              and multi-step configuration (for example, in case
              resources in an earlier step need to be started before
              configuring the next set of resources). Wizards are also
              able to perform complex actions like installing and
              configuring necessary software packages.
            </p>

            <h4>Integrated dashboard</h4>
            <p>
              The multi-cluster dashboard has been integrated into the
              main interface. Now you can monitor multiple clusters
              directly from the regular Hawk UI.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="l-box-lrg pure-u-1 pure-u-md-2-3">
            <h4>New Pacemaker Features</h4>
            <p>
              We support many features that have been added recently
              to the Pacemaker resource manager: <strong>Location
              constraints</strong> apply to several resources at
              once. <strong>Tags</strong> are a lightweight way to
              manage related resources without any dependency between
              them. <strong>Remote nodes</strong> lets you manage both
              hypervisors and resources running inside virtual
              machines as a single cluster. And more!
            </p>

            <h4>Configuration view and Command Log</h4>
            <p>
              To make the transition between command line usage and
              the web interface easier, we've added the ability to
              view the current cluster configuration in the command
              line format, complete with syntax highlighting. Also,
              the command log provides a list of recent commands
              executed on the cluster from the web interface. This can
              serve as a basic audit log, as well as helping new users
              learn the command line interface directly by performing
              operations on the cluster.
            </p>

            <h4>History Explorer and Simulator</h4>
            <p>
              Together with the general improvements to the interface,
              the History Explorer has been redesigned to be easier to
              use and more powerful. Now you can see more details for
              each transition, as well as easily navigate forward and
              backward in time through a report. The History Explorer
              now also shows a summary of important events directly
              when opening the report, to make it easy to find the
              relevant events in the log. The report generation,
              download and upload functions are all now accessible
              from a single location.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, the Simulator has been updated to not only be
              prettier (if you ever used the old version, you'll know
              what I mean) but also easier to use.
